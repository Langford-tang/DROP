 Successive Over-Relaxation
 --------------------------
 --------------------------
 1) Successive Over-Relaxation Method for A.x = b; A - n x n square matrix, x - unknown vector, b - RHS vector
 2) Decompose A into Diagonal, Lower, and upper Triangular Matrices; A = D + L + U
 3) SOR Scheme uses omega input
 4) Forward subsitution scheme to iteratively determine the x_i's
 5) SOR Scheme Linear System Convergence: Inputs A and D, Jacobi Iteration Matrix Spectral Radius, omega
	- Construct Jacobi Iteration Matrix: C_Jacobian = I - (Inverse D) A
	- Convergence Verification #1: Ensure that Jacobi Iteration Matrix Spectral Radius is < 1
	- Convergence Verification #2: Ensure omega between 0 and 2
	- Optimal Relaxation Parameter Expression in terms of Jacobi Iteration Matrix Spectral Radius
	- Omega Based Convergence Rate Expression
	- Gauss-Seidel omega = 1; corresponding Convergence Rate
	- Optimal Omega Convergence Rate
 6) SSOR Algorithm - Inputs; A, omega, and gamma
	- Decompose into D and L
	- Pre-conditioner Matrix: Expression from SSOR 
	- Finally SSOR Iteration Formula
 7) Generic Iterative Solver Method:
	- Inputs: Iterator Function(x) and omega
	- Unrelaxed Iterated variable: x_n+1 = f(x_n)
	- SOR Based Iterated variable: x_n+1 = (1-omega).x_n + omega.f(x_n)
	- SOR Based Iterated variable for Unknown Vector x: x_n+1 = (1-omega).x_n + omega.(L_star inverse)(b - U.x_n)

 Tridiagonal matrix algorithm
 ----------------------------
 ----------------------------
 1) Is Tridiagonal Check
 2) Core Algorithm:
	- C Prime's and D Prime's Calculation
	- Back Substitution for the Result
	- Modified better Book-keeping algorithm
 3) Sherman-Morrison Algorithm:
	- Choice of gamma
	- Construct Tridiagonal B from A and gamma
	- u Column from gamma and c_n
	- v Column from a_1 and gamma
	- Solve for y from By=d
	- Solve for q from Bq=u
	- Use Sherman Morrison Formula to extract x
 4) Alternate Boundary Condition Algorithm:
	- Solve Au=d for u
	- Solve Av={-a_2, 0, ..., -c_n} for v
	- Full solution is x_i = u_i + x_1 * v_i
	- x_1 if computed using formula
