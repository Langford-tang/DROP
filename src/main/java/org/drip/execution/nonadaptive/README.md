DROP Execution Non-Adaptive Package generates the Almgren-Chriss Static Optimal Trajectory.

## Class Components

 * [***Continuous Almgren Chriss***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousAlmgrenChriss.java)
 <i>ContinuousAlmgrenChriss</i> contains the Continuous Version of the Discrete Trading Trajectory generated
 by the Almgren and Chriss (2000) Scheme under the Criterion of No-Drift.

 * [***Continuous Constant Trading Enhanced***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousConstantTradingEnhanced.java)
 <i>ContinuousConstantTradingEnhanced</i> contains the Constant Volatility Trading Trajectory generated by
 the Almgren and Chriss (2003) Scheme under the Criterion of No-Drift AND Constant Temporary Impact
 Volatility.

 * [***Continuous Coordinated Variation Deterministic***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousCoordinatedVariationDeterministic.java)
 <i>ContinuousCoordinatedVariationDeterministic</i> uses the Coordinated Variation Version of the Linear
 Participation Rate Transaction Function as described in the "Trading Time" Model to construct an Optimal
 Trading Trajectory.

 * [***Continuous Coordinated Variation Stochastic***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousCoordinatedVariationStochastic.java)
 <i>ContinuousCoordinatedVariationStochastic</i> uses the Coordinated Variation Version of the Linear
 Participation Rate Transaction Function as described in the "Trading Time" Model to construct an Optimal
 Trading Trajectory in the T To Infinite Limit.

 * [***Continuous High Urgency Asymptote***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousHighUrgencyAsymptote.java)
 <i>ContinuousHighUrgencyAsymptote</i> contains the High Urgency Asymptote of the Static Continuous Trading
 Trajectory generated by the Almgren and Chriss (2000) Scheme under the Criterion of No-Drift.

 * [***Continuous Low Urgency Asymptote***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousLowUrgencyAsymptote.java)
 <i>ContinuousLowUrgencyAsymptote</i> contains the Low Urgency Asymptote of the Static Continuous Trading
 Trajectory generated by the Almgren and Chriss (2000) Scheme under the Criterion of No-Drift.

 * [***Continuous Power Impact***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/ContinuousPowerImpact.java)
 <i>ContinuousPowerImpact</i> contains the Temporary Impact Power Law Trading Trajectory generated by the
 Almgren and Chriss (2003) Scheme under the Criterion of No-Drift.

 * [***Discrete Almgren Chriss***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/DiscreteAlmgrenChriss.java)
 <i>DiscreteAlmgrenChriss</i> generates the Trade/Holdings List of Optimal Execution Schedule for the Equally
 Spaced Trading Intervals based on the No-Drift Linear Impact Evolution Walk Parameters specified.

 * [***Discrete Almgren Chriss Drift***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/DiscreteAlmgrenChrissDrift.java)
 <i>DiscreteAlmgrenChrissDrift</i> generates the Trade/Holdings List of Optimal Execution Schedule for the
 Equally Spaced Trading Intervals based on the Linear Impact Evolution Walk Parameters with Drift specified.

 * [***Discrete Linear Trading Enhanced***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/DiscreteLinearTradingEnhanced.java)
 <i>DiscreteLinearTradingEnhanced</i> contains the Volatility Trading Trajectory generated by the Almgren
 (2003) Scheme under the Criterion of No-Drift AND Linear Temporary Impact Volatility.

 * [***Static Optimal Scheme***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/StaticOptimalScheme.java)
 <i>StaticOptimalScheme</i> generates the Trade/Holdings List of Static Optimal Execution Schedule based on
 the Discrete/Continuous Trade Trajectory Control, the Price Walk Parameters, and the Objective Utility
 Function.

 * [***Static Optimal Scheme Continuous***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/StaticOptimalSchemeContinuous.java)
 <i>StaticOptimalSchemeContinuous</i> generates the Trade/Holdings List of Static Optimal Execution Schedule
 based on the Continuous Trade Trajectory Control, the Price Walk Parameters, and the Objective Utility
 Function.

 * [***Static Optimal Scheme Discrete***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/execution/nonadaptive/StaticOptimalSchemeDiscrete.java)
 <i>StaticOptimalSchemeDiscrete</i> generates the Trade/Holdings List of Static Optimal Execution Schedule
 based on the Discrete Trade Trajectory Control, the Price Walk Parameters, and the Objective Utility
 Function.
