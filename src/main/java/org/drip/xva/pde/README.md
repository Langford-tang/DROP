DROP XVA PDE Package implements the Burgard Kjaer PDE Evolution Scheme.


## Class Components

 * [***BurgardKjaerEdge***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/xva/pde/BurgardKjaerEdge.java)
 <i>BurgardKjaerEdge</i> holds the Underlier Stochastic and the Credit Risk Free Components of the XVA
 Derivative Value Growth, as laid out in Burgard and Kjaer (2014).

 * [***BurgardKjaerEdgeAttribution***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/xva/pde/BurgardKjaerEdgeAttribution.java)
 <i>BurgardKjaerEdgeAttribution</i> collects the Attribution Components of the Burgard Kjaer PDE based on the
 Risk-Neutral Ito Evolution of the Derivative, as laid out in Burgard and Kjaer (2014).

 * [***BurgardKjaerEdgeRun***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/xva/pde/BurgardKjaerEdgeRun.java)
 <i>BurgardKjaerEdgeRun</i> collects the Results of the Burgard Kjaer PDE based on the Risk-Neutral Ito
 Evolution of the Derivative, as laid out in Burgard and Kjaer (2014).

 * [***BurgardKjaerOperator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/xva/pde/BurgardKjaerOperator.java)
 <i>BurgardKjaerOperator</i> sets up the Parabolic Differential Equation PDE based on the Ito Evolution
 Differential for the Reference Underlier Asset, as laid out in Burgard and Kjaer (2014).

 * [***ParabolicDifferentialOperator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/xva/pde/ParabolicDifferentialOperator.java)
 <i>ParabolicDifferentialOperator</i> sets up the Parabolic Differential Equation based on the Ito Evolution
 Differential for the Reference Underlier Asset, as laid out in Burgard and Kjaer (2014).

 * [***TrajectoryEvolutionScheme***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/xva/pde/TrajectoryEvolutionScheme.java)
 <i>TrajectoryEvolutionScheme</i> holds the Evolution Edges of a Trajectory evolved in a Dynamically Adaptive
 Manner, as laid out in Burgard and Kjaer (2014).
