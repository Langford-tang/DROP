DROP Measure Lebesgue implements the Uniform Piece-wise Lebesgue Measure.


## Class Components

 * [***R1PiecewiseDisplaced***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/lebesgue/R1PiecewiseDisplaced.java)
 <i>R1PiecewiseDisplaced</i> implements the Displaced Piecewise Linear R<sup>1</sup> Distributions. It
 exports the Methods corresponding to the R<sup>1</sup> Lebesgue Base Class.

 * [***R1PiecewiseLinear***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/lebesgue/R1PiecewiseLinear.java)
 <i>R1PiecewiseLinear</i> implements the Piecewise Linear R<sup>1</sup> Distributions. It exports the Methods
 corresponding to the R<sup>1</sup> Lebesgue Base Class.

 * [***R1Uniform***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/lebesgue/R1Uniform.java)
 <i>R1Uniform</i> implements the R<sup>1</sup> Lebesgue (i.e., Bounded Uniform) Distribution, with a Uniform
 Distribution between a Lower and an Upper Bound.

 * [***RdUniform***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/lebesgue/RdUniform.java)
 <i>RdUniform</i> implements the R<sup>d</sup> Lebesgue Measure Distribution that corresponds to a Uniform
 R<sup>d</sup> d-Volume Space.
