DROP Measure Continuous implements the R<sup>1</sup> R<sup>d</sup> Continuous Random Measure.


## Class Components

 * [***Multivariate***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/Multivariate.java)
 <i>Multivariate</i> contains the Generalized Multivariate Distributions.

 * [***MultivariateMeta***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/MultivariateMeta.java)
 <i>MultivariateMeta</i> holds a Group of Variable Names - each of which separately is a Valid Single
 R<sup>1</sup>/R<sup>d</sup> Variable.

 * [***R1R1***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/R1R1.java)
 <i>R1R1</i> implements the Base Abstract Class behind Bivariate R<sup>1</sup> Distributions. It exports
 Methods for Incremental, Cumulative, and Inverse Cumulative Distribution Densities.

 <i>R1Univariate</i> implements the Base Abstract Class behind Univariate R<sup>1</sup> Distributions. It exports the Methods for incremental, cumulative, and inverse cumulative distribution densities.

 * [***R1UnivariateExponential***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/R1UnivariateExponential.java)
 <i>R1UnivariateExponential</i> implements the Univariate R<sup>1</sup> Exponential Distribution. It implements the Incremental, the Cumulative, and the Inverse Cumulative Distribution Densities.

 * [***R1UnivariateScaledExponential***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/R1UnivariateScaledExponential.java)
 <i>R1UnivariateScaledExponential</i> implements the Probability Density Function for the Scaled Univariate R<sup>1</sup> Exponential Function.

 * [***R1UnivariateUniform***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/R1UnivariateUniform.java)
 <i>R1UnivariateUniform</i> implements the Univariate R<sup>1</sup> Uniform Distribution. It implements the Incremental, the Cumulative, and the Inverse Cumulative Distribution Densities.

 * [***Rd***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/Rd.java)
 <i>Rd</i> implements the Base Abstract Class behind R<sup>d</sup> Distributions. It exports Methods for
 incremental, cumulative, and inverse cumulative Distribution Densities.

 * [***RdR1***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/continuous/RdR1.java)
 <i>RdR1</i> implements the Base Abstract Class behind R<sup>d</sup> X R<sup>1</sup> Distributions. It
 exports Methods for incremental, cumulative, and inverse cumulative Distribution Densities.
