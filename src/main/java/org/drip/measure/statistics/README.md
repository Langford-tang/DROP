## Class Components

 * [***MultivariateDiscrete***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/statistics/MultivariateDiscrete.java)
 <i>MultivariateDiscrete</i> analyzes and computes the Moment and Metric Statistics for the Realized
 Multivariate Sequence.

 * [***MultivariateMoments***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/statistics/MultivariateMoments.java)
 <i>MultivariateMoments</i> generates and holds the Specified Multivariate Series Mean, Co-variance, and other
 selected Moments.

 * [***PopulationCentralMeasures***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/statistics/PopulationCentralMeasures.java)
 <i>PopulationCentralMeasures</i> holds the Population Central Measures (Mean, and Variance) of the Population.

 * [***UnivariateDiscreteThin***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/statistics/UnivariateDiscreteThin.java)
 <i>UnivariateDiscreteThin</i> analyzes and computes the "Thin" Statistics for the Realized Univariate
 Sequence.

 * [***UnivariateMoments***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/measure/statistics/UnivariateMoments.java)
 <i>UnivariateMoments</i> generates and holds the Specified Univariate Series Mean, Variance, and a few
 selected Moments.
