DROP Exposure MPoR Package computes the Margin Period Collateral Amount Estimates.

## Class Components

 * [***CollateralAmountEstimator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/CollateralAmountEstimator.java)
 <i>CollateralAmountEstimator</i> estimates the Amount of Collateral Hypothecation that is to be Posted
 during a Single Run of a Collateral Hypothecation Group Valuation.

 * [***CollateralAmountEstimatorOutput***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/CollateralAmountEstimatorOutput.java)
 <i>CollateralAmountEstimatorOutput</i> contains the Estimation Output of the Hypothecation Collateral that
 is to be Posted during a Single Run of a Collateral Hypothecation Group Valuation.

 * [***MarginPeriodOfRisk***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/MarginPeriodOfRisk.java)
 <i>MarginPeriodOfRisk</i> contains the Margining Information associated with the Client Exposure.

 * [***PathVariationMarginTrajectoryEstimator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/PathVariationMarginTrajectoryEstimator.java)
 <i>PathVariationMarginTrajectoryEstimator</i> computes the Variation Margin Estimate/Posting from the
 specified Dense Uncollateralized Exposures and Trade Payments along the specified Path Trajectory.

 * [***TradePayment***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/TradePayment.java)
 <i>TradePayment</i> holds the Dealer (Negative) and Client (Positive) Trade Payments at an Exposure Date.

 * [***VariationMarginTradePaymentVertex***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/VariationMarginTradePaymentVertex.java)
 <i>VariationMarginTradePaymentVertex</i> exposes the Generation of the Estimated Variation Margin and the
 Trade Payment at a Vertex off of the Realized Market Path.

 * [***VariationMarginTradeVertexExposure***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/VariationMarginTradeVertexExposure.java)
 <i>VariationMarginTradeVertexExposure</i> holds the Variation Margin, Trade Payments, and Exposures for a
 specific Forward Vertex Date.

 * [***VariationMarginTrajectoryBuilder***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/exposure/mpor/VariationMarginTrajectoryBuilder.java)
 <i>VariationMarginTrajectoryBuilder</i> builds the Variation Margin Trajectory using several Techniques.
