 *  This file is part of DROP, an open-source library targeting analytics/risk, transaction cost analytics,
 *  	asset liability management analytics, capital, exposure, and margin analytics, valuation adjustment
 *  	analytics, and portfolio construction analytics within and across fixed income, credit, commodity,
 *  	equity, FX, and structured products. It also includes auxiliary libraries for algorithm support,
 *  	numerical analysis, numerical optimization, spline builder, model validation, statistical learning,
 *  	graph builder/navigator, and computational support.
 *  
 *  	https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP/
 *  
 *  DROP is composed of three modules:
 *  
 *  - DROP Product Core - https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP-Product-Core/
 *  - DROP Portfolio Core - https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP-Portfolio-Core/
 *  - DROP Computational Core - https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP-Computational-Core/
 * 
 * 	DROP Product Core implements libraries for the following:
 * 	- Fixed Income Analytics
 * 	- Loan Analytics
 * 	- Transaction Cost Analytics
 * 
 * 	DROP Portfolio Core implements libraries for the following:
 * 	- Asset Allocation Analytics
 *  - Asset Liability Management Analytics
 * 	- Capital Estimation Analytics
 * 	- Exposure Analytics
 * 	- Margin Analytics
 * 	- XVA Analytics
 * 
 * 	DROP Computational Core implements libraries for the following:
 * 	- Algorithm Support
 * 	- Computation Support
 * 	- Function Analysis
 *  - Graph Algorithm
 *  - Model Validation
 * 	- Numerical Analysis
 * 	- Numerical Optimizer

 * <i>VariateIterationSelectorParams</i> implements the control parameters for the compound variate selector
 * scheme used in Brent's method.
 * <br><br>
 * Brent's method uses the following fields in VariateIterationSelectorParams to generate the next variate:
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The Variate Primitive that is regarded as the "fast" method
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The Variate Primitive that is regarded as the "robust" method
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The relative variate shift that determines when the "robust" method is to be invoked over the "fast"
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The lower bound on the variate shift between iterations that serves as the fall-back to the "robust"
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 *
