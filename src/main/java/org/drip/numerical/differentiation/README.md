DROP Numerical Differentiation Package implements the R<sup>1</sup> To R<sup>1</sup> Numerical
	Differentiation.


## Class Components

 * [***DerivativeControl***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/differentiation/DerivativeControl.java)
 <i>DerivativeControl</i> provides bumps needed for numerically approximating derivatives. Bumps can be
 absolute or relative, and they default to a floor.

 * [***Differential***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/differentiation/Differential.java)
 <i>Differential</i> holds the incremental differentials for the variate and the objective function.

 * [***WengertJacobian***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/differentiation/WengertJacobian.java)
 <i>WengertJacobian</i> contains the Jacobian of the given set of Wengert variables to the set of parameters.
 It exposes the following functionality:
 	* Set/Retrieve the Wengert variables
 	* Accumulate the Partials
 	* Scale the partial entries
 	* Merge the Jacobian with another
 	* Retrieve the Wengert Jacobian elements
 	* Display the contents of the Wengert Jacobian
