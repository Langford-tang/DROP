## Class Components

 * [***CPGACollateralized***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/xvadigest/CPGACollateralized.java)
 <i>CPGACollateralized</i> illustrates the Counter Party Aggregation over Netting Groups based Collateralized Collateral Groups with several Fix-Float Swaps.

 * [***CPGACollateralizedCorrelated***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/xvadigest/CPGACollateralizedCorrelated.java)
 <i>CPGACollateralizedCorrelated</i> illustrates the Counter Party Aggregation over Netting Groups based Collateralized Collateral Groups with several Fix-Float Swaps where the Market Numeraires have Correlated Realizations.

 * [***CPGAUncollateralized***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/xvadigest/CPGAUncollateralized.java)
 <i>CPGAUncollateralized</i> illustrates the Counter Party Aggregation over Netting Groups based Uncollateralized Collateral Groups with several Fix-Float Swaps.

 * [***CPGAUncollateralizedCorrelated***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/xvadigest/CPGAUncollateralizedCorrelated.java)
 <i>CPGAUncollateralizedCorrelated</i> illustrates the Counter Party Aggregation over Netting Groups based Uncollateralized Collateral Groups with several Fix-Float Swaps where the Market Numeraires have Correlated Realizations.

 * [***CPGAZeroThreshold***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/xvadigest/CPGAZeroThreshold.java)
 <i>CPGAZeroThreshold</i> illustrates the Counter Party Aggregation over Netting Groups based Collateralized Collateral Groups with several Fix-Float Swaps under Zero Collateral Threshold.

 * [***CPGAZeroThresholdCorrelated***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/xvadigest/CPGAZeroThresholdCorrelated.java)
 <i>CPGAZeroThresholdCorrelated</i> illustrates the Counter Party Aggregation over Netting Groups based Collateralized Collateral Groups with several Fix-Float Swaps under Zero Collateral Threshold, and with built in Factor Correlations across the Numeraires.
