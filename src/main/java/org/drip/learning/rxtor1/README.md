DROP Learning R<sup>x</sup> -> R<sup>1</sup> the Suite of Statistical Learning Empirical Loss Penalizers.


## Class Components

 * [***ApproximateLipschitzLossLearner***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/ApproximateLipschitzLossLearner.java)
 <i>ApproximateLipschitzLossLearner</i> implements the Learner Class that holds the Space of Normed
 R<sup>d</sup> To Normed R<sup>1</sup> Learning Functions for the Family of Loss Functions that are
 "approximately" Lipschitz, i.e.,
 
 				loss (ep) - loss (ep') Less Than max (C * |ep-ep'|, C')

 * [***EmpiricalLearningMetricEstimator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/EmpiricalLearningMetricEstimator.java)
 <i>EmpiricalLearningMetricEstimator</i> is the Estimator of the Empirical Loss and Risk, as well as the
 corresponding Covering Numbers.

 * [***EmpiricalPenaltySupremum***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/EmpiricalPenaltySupremum.java)
 <i>EmpiricalPenaltySupremum</i> holds the Learning Function that corresponds to the Empirical Supremum, as
 well as the corresponding Supremum Value.

 * [***EmpiricalPenaltySupremumEstimator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/EmpiricalPenaltySupremumEstimator.java)
 <i>EmpiricalPenaltySupremumEstimator</i> contains the Implementation of the Empirical Penalty Supremum
 Estimator dependent on Multivariate Random Variables where the Multivariate Function is a Linear Combination
 of Bounded Univariate Functions acting on each Random Variate.

 * [***EmpiricalPenaltySupremumMetrics***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/EmpiricalPenaltySupremumMetrics.java)
 <i>EmpiricalPenaltySupremumMetrics</i> computes Efron-Stein Metrics for the Penalty Supremum R<sup>x</sup>
 To R<sup>1</sup> Functions.

 * [***GeneralizedLearner***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/GeneralizedLearner.java)
 <i>GeneralizedLearner</i> implements the Learner Class that holds the Space of Normed R<sup>x</sup> To
 Normed R<sup>1</sup> Learning Functions along with their Custom Empirical Loss. Class-Specific Asymptotic
 Sample, Covering Number based Upper Probability Bounds and other Parameters are also maintained.

 * [***L1LossLearner***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/L1LossLearner.java)
 <i>L1LossLearner</i> implements the Learner Class that holds the Space of Normed R<sup>x</sup> To Normed
 R<sup>1</sup> Learning Functions that employs L<sub>1</sub> Empirical Loss Routine. Class-Specific
 Asymptotic Sample, Covering Number based Upper Probability Bounds and other Parameters are also maintained.

 * [***LipschitzLossLearner***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/LipschitzLossLearner.java)
 <i>LipschitzLossLearner</i> implements the Learner Class that holds the Space of Normed R<sup>1</sup> To
 Normed R<sup>1</sup> Learning Functions for the Family of Loss Functions that are Lipschitz, i.e.,

 				loss (ep) - loss (ep') Less Than C * |ep-ep'|

 * [***LpLossLearner***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/learning/rxtor1/LpLossLearner.java)
 <i>LpLossLearner</i> implements the Learner Class that holds the Space of Normed R<sup>x</sup> To Normed
 R<sup>1</sup> Learning Functions for the Family of Loss Functions that are Polynomial, i.e.,

 				loss (eta) = (eta ^ p) / p,  for p greater than 1.

 This is Lipschitz, with a Lipschitz Slope of

 				C = (b - a) ^ (p - 1).
