DROP State Forward Package implements the Forward Latent State Curve Estimator.


## Class Components

 * [***ForwardCurve***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/state/forward/ForwardCurve.java)
 <i>ForwardCurve</i> is the stub for the forward curve functionality. It extends the Curve object by exposing
 the following functions:
 	* The name/epoch of the forward rate instance
 	* The index/currency/tenor associated with the forward rate instance
 	* Forward Rate to a specific date/tenor
 	* Generate scenario tweaked Latent State from the base forward curve corresponding to mode adjusted
 		(flat/parallel/custom) manifest measure/quantification metric
 	* Retrieve array of latent state manifest measure, instrument quantification metric, and the array of
 		calibration components
 	* Set/retrieve curve construction input instrument sets

 * [***ForwardRateEstimator***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/state/forward/ForwardRateEstimator.java)
 <i>ForwardRateEstimator</i> is the interface that exposes the calculation of the Forward Rate for a specific
 Index. It exposes methods to compute forward rates to a given date/tenor, extract the forward rate index and
 the Tenor.
