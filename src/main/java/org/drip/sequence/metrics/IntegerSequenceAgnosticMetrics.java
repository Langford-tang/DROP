 *  This file is part of DROP, an open-source library targeting risk, transaction costs, exposure, margin
 *  	calculations, and portfolio construction within and across fixed income, credit, commodity, equity,
 *  	FX, and structured products.
 *  
 *  	https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP/
 *  
 *  DROP is composed of three main modules:
 *  
 *  - DROP Analytics Core - https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP-Analytics-Core/
 *  - DROP Portfolio Core - https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP-Portfolio-Core/
 *  - DROP Numerical Core - https://lakshmidrip.github.io/DROP-Numerical-Core/
 * 
 * 	DROP Analytics Core implements libraries for the following:
 * 	- Fixed Income Analytics
 * 	- Asset Backed Analytics
 * 	- XVA Analytics
 * 	- Exposure and Margin Analytics
 * 
 * 	DROP Portfolio Core implements libraries for the following:
 * 	- Asset Allocation Analytics
 * 	- Transaction Cost Analytics
 * 
 * 	DROP Numerical Core implements libraries for the following:
 * 	- Statistical Learning Library
 * 	- Numerical Optimizer Library
 * 	- Machine Learning Library
 * 	- Spline Builder Library
 * 
 * 	Documentation for DROP is Spread Over:
