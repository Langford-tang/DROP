DROP Spline Multidimensional Package contains Multidimensional Wire Surface Stretch.


## Class Components

 * [***WireSurfacePiecewiseConstant***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/spline/multidimensional/WireSurfacePiecewiseConstant.java)
 <i>WireSurfacePiecewiseConstant</i> implements the piecewise Constant version of the 2D Spline Response
 Surface. It synthesizes this from an array of 1D Span Instances, each of which is referred to as wire spline
 in this case.

 * [***WireSurfaceStretch***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/spline/multidimensional/WireSurfaceStretch.java)
 <i>WireSurfaceStretch</i> implements a 2D spline surface stretch. It synthesizes this from an array of 1D
 Span instances, each of which is referred to as wire spline in this case.
