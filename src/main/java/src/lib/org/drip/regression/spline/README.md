DROP Regression Spline implements the Custom Basis Spline Regression Engine.


## Class Components

 * [***BasisSplineRegressionEngine***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/regression/spline/BasisSplineRegressionEngine.java)
 <i>BasisSplineRegressionEngine</i> implements the RegressionEngine class for the basis spline functionality.

 * [***BasisSplineRegressor***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/regression/spline/BasisSplineRegressor.java)
 <i>BasisSplineRegressor</i> implements the custom basis spline regressor for the given basis spline. As part
 of the regression run, it executes the following:
 	* Calibrate and compute the left and the right Jacobian.
 	* Reset right node and re-run calibration.
 	* Compute an intermediate value Jacobian.

 * [***BasisSplineRegressorSet***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/regression/spline/BasisSplineRegressorSet.java)
 <i>BasisSplineRegressorSet</i> carries out regression testing for the following series of basis splines:
 	* #1: Polynomial Basis Spline, n = 2 basis functions, and Ck = 0.
 	* #2: Polynomial Basis Spline, n = 3 basis functions, and Ck = 1.

 	* #15: Polynomial Basis Spline, n = 7 basis functions, and Ck = 4.
 	* #16: Polynomial Basis Spline, n = 7 basis functions, and Ck = 5.
 	* #17: Bernstein Polynomial Basis Spline, n = 4 basis functions, and Ck = 2.
 	* #18: Exponential Tension Spline, n = 4 basis functions, Tension = 1., and Ck = 2.
 	* #19: Hyperbolic Tension Spline, n = 4 basis functions, Tension = 1., and Ck = 2.
 	* #20: Kaklis-Pandelis Tension Spline, n = 4 basis functions, KP = 2, and Ck = 2.
 	* #21: C1 Hermite Local Spline, n = 4 basis functions, and Ck = 1.
  	* #22: Hermite Local Spline with Local, Catmull-Rom, and Cardinal Knots, n = 4 basis functions, and
  		Ck = 1.

 * [***HermiteBasisSplineRegressor***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/regression/spline/HermiteBasisSplineRegressor.java)
 <i>HermiteBasisSplineRegressor</i> implements the Hermite basis spline regressor for the given basis spline.
 As part of the regression run, it executes the following:
 	* Calibrate and compute the left and the right Jacobian.
 	* Reset right node and re-run calibration.
 	* Compute an intermediate value Jacobian.

 * [***LagrangePolynomialStretchRegressor***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/regression/spline/LagrangePolynomialStretchRegressor.java)
 <i>LagrangePolynomialStretchRegressor</i> implements the local control basis spline regressor for the given
 basis spline. As part of the regression run, it executes the following:
 	* Calibrate and compute the left and the right Jacobian.
 	* Insert the Local Control Hermite, Cardinal, and Catmull-Rom knots.
 	* Compute an intermediate value Jacobian.

 * [***LocalControlBasisSplineRegressor***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/regression/spline/LocalControlBasisSplineRegressor.java)
 <i>LocalControlBasisSplineRegressor</i> implements the local control basis spline regressor for the given
 basis spline. As part of the regression run, it executes the following:
 	* Calibrate and compute the left and the right Jacobian.
 	* Insert the Local Control Hermite, Cardinal, and Catmull-Rom knots.
 	* Run Regressor for the C1 Local Control C1 Slope Insertion Bessel/Hermite Spline.
 	* Compute an intermediate value Jacobian.
