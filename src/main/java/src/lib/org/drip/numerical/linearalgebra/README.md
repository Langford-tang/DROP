DROP Numerical Linear Algebra Package implements the Linear Algebra Matrix Transform Library.


## Class Components

 * [***LinearizationOutput***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/linearalgebra/LinearizationOutput.java)
 <i>LinearizationOutput</i> holds the output of a sequence of linearization operations. It contains the
 transformed original matrix, the transformed RHS, and the method used for the linearization operation.

 * [***LinearSystemSolver***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/linearalgebra/LinearSystemSolver.java)
 <i>LinearSystemSolver</i> implements the solver for a system of linear equations given by

											A * x = B

 where A is the matrix, x the set of variables, and B is the result to be solved for. It exports the
 following functions:
 	* Row Regularization and Diagonal Pivoting
 	* Check for Diagonal Dominance
 	* Solving the linear system using any one of the following: Gaussian Elimination, Gauss Seidel reduction,
 		or matrix inversion.

 * [***Matrix***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/linearalgebra/Matrix.java)
 <i>Matrix</i> implements Matrix manipulation routines. It exports the following functionality:
 	* Matrix Inversion using Closed form solutions (for low-dimension matrices), or using Gaussian
 		elimination
 	* Matrix Product
 	* Matrix Diagonalization and Diagonal Pivoting
 	* Matrix Regularization through Row Addition/Row Swap

 * [***MatrixComplementTransform***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/linearalgebra/MatrixComplementTransform.java)
 <i>MatrixComplementTransform</i> holds the results of Matrix transforms on the source and the complement,
 e.g., during a Matrix Inversion Operation.

 * [***QR***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/linearalgebra/QR.java)
 <i>QR</i> holds the Results of QR Decomposition - viz., the Q and the R Matrices.

 * [***UD***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/numerical/linearalgebra/UD.java)
 <i>UD</i> holds the U and the D Matrices that form the Result of the UDU Transpose Decomposition.
