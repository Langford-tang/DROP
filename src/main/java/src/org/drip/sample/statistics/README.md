DROP Statistics illustrates Usage of the Correlated R<sup>d</sup> Random Sequence Statistics.


## Class Components

 * [***CorrelatedRdSequence***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/statistics/CorrelatedRdSequence.java)
 <i>CorrelatedRdSequence</i> demonstrates the Generation of the Statistical Measures for the Input Correlated Sequence Set created using the Multi-Path Correlated Random Variable Generator without Quadratic Re-sampling or Antithetic Variables.

 * [***CorrelatedRdSequenceAntithetic***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/statistics/CorrelatedRdSequenceAntithetic.java)
 <i>CorrelatedRdSequenceAntithetic</i> demonstrates the Generation of the Statistical Measures for the Input Correlated Sequence Set created using the Multi-Path Correlated Random Variable Generator without Quadratic Re-sampling, but with Antithetic Variables.

 * [***CorrelatedRdSequenceQR***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/statistics/CorrelatedRdSequenceQR.java)
 <i>CorrelatedRdSequenceQR</i> demonstrates the Generation of the Statistical Measures for the Input Correlated Sequence Set created using the Multi-Path Correlated Random Variable Generator using Quadratic Re-sampling but without Antithetic Variables.

 * [***CorrelatedRdSequenceQRUnbiased***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/statistics/CorrelatedRdSequenceQRUnbiased.java)
 <i>CorrelatedRdSequenceQRUnbiased</i> demonstrates the Generation of the Statistical Measures for the Input Correlated Sequence Set created using the Multi-Path Correlated Random Variable Generator using Unbiased Quadratic Re-sampling but without Antithetic Variables.

 * [***MultivariateSequence***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/statistics/MultivariateSequence.java)
 <i>MultivariateSequence</i> demonstrates the Generation of the Statistical Measures for the Input Series of Multivariate Sequences.

 * [***UnivariateSequence***](https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DROP/tree/master/src/main/java/org/drip/sample/statistics/UnivariateSequence.java)
 <i>UnivariateSequence</i> demonstrates the Generation of the Statistical Measures for the Input Series of Univariate Sequences.
